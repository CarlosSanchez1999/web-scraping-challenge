# Mars Data Exploration

## Project Overview
This project explores Mars-related data through web scraping and data analysis. The focus is on extracting recent Mars news headlines and analyzing weather data from the Curiosity rover, including temperature and atmospheric pressure variations. During the project, we encountered challenges in sorting and plotting the graphs correctly, but we resolved this by converting the sorted values to strings, ensuring the graphs reflected the correct order.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**:
  - Collected Mars news headlines and summaries using web scraping techniques.
  - Scraped weather data from NASA's Mars Facts website for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Explored patterns in Martian weather, including temperature and atmospheric pressure.
  - Visualized seasonal trends on Mars through graphs.

## Data and Visualizations
- **Mars News**:
  - Extracted the latest news articles related to Mars exploration.
- **Martian Weather**:
  - Analyzed minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure trends.
  - Created bar and line plots showing seasonal variations on Mars.

## Libraries Used for Web Scraping
